# PART1_Arithmetic
Java is very similar to other programming languages in its syntax of arithmetic, so doing maths won't be so bad.

To manipulate numerical values, as almost any program you write will have to, Java - like any programming language -
provides standard "arithmetic operators," which perform all of your basic math functions.

Arithmetic Operators:
- Addition: '+'
- Subtraction: '-'
- Multiplication: '*'
- Division '/'

This code snippet contained more than arithmetic operators, however; it also contained *assignment operators*.
Their form is very similar to to the arithmetic operators. You just have to remember the fundamental difference
between arithmetic operators and assignment operators: arithmetic operators perform their mathematical function,
assignment operators perform their mathematical function *and* save it to the variable. Their syntax is shown below.

Assignment Operators:
- Addition: "+="
- Subtraction: "-="
- Multiplication: "*="
- Division "/="

Since arithmetic is something you've done since preschool, the critical takeaway from this section is recognizing that 
Java doesn't store functions, it stores value. If you set variable 'A' to some value that uses variable 'B', and later 
change variable 'B' to a different value, variable 'A' still stores the exact same value.
